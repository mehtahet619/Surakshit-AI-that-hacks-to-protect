# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Surakshit is an AI-powered remediation-first penetration testing companion that transforms security vulnerability detection into actionable, developer-friendly fixes. Unlike traditional security scanners that only report issues, Surakshit automatically generates safe, minimal, test-backed remediation code packaged as draft pull requests. The system integrates seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines while maintaining strict human-in-the-loop approval processes to ensure security and reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Security Finding Processing

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want to input validated security findings with complete context, so that Surakshit can generate appropriate remediation strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a security finding is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate the finding contains finding_id, evidence, and repo/branch information
2. WHEN finding validation fails THEN the system SHALL return detailed error messages indicating missing or invalid fields
3. WHEN a valid finding is received THEN the system SHALL generate a unique session_id for tracking and auditability
4. IF the finding_id already exists in the current session THEN the system SHALL reject duplicate submissions with appropriate error messaging

### Requirement 2: Remediation Strategy Generation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want multiple ranked remediation options for each vulnerability, so that I can choose the approach that best fits my project's constraints and timeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a security finding THEN the system SHALL generate 1-3 ranked remediation strategies
2. WHEN generating strategies THEN the system SHALL include quick patch, full fix, and long-term hardening options where applicable
3. WHEN ranking strategies THEN the system SHALL prioritize based on implementation complexity, security effectiveness, and maintainability
4. WHEN explaining strategies THEN the system SHALL provide clear rationale for each approach including trade-offs and considerations

### Requirement 3: Code Remediation Generation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatically generated, PR-ready code fixes, so that I can quickly implement security remediations without manual coding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a remediation strategy is selected THEN the system SHALL generate a unified diff patch ready for pull request creation
2. WHEN generating patches THEN the system SHALL ensure all changes are minimal and focused only on the security issue
3. WHEN creating fixes THEN the system SHALL follow least-privilege principles and maintain existing functionality
4. WHEN generating code THEN the system SHALL include appropriate comments explaining the security remediation

### Requirement 4: Rollback and Safety Mechanisms

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automatic rollback capabilities for all security fixes, so that I can quickly revert changes if issues arise in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a remediation patch THEN the system SHALL create a corresponding rollback diff
2. WHEN creating rollback diffs THEN the system SHALL ensure complete restoration of original functionality
3. WHEN safety mechanisms are triggered THEN the system SHALL prevent any auto-execution without explicit human approval
4. IF rollback is initiated THEN the system SHALL log the rollback action with session tracking

### Requirement 5: Test Generation and Validation

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want automatically generated tests for security fixes, so that I can validate remediation effectiveness and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating remediations THEN the system SHALL create appropriate unit, integration, and smoke tests
2. WHEN creating tests THEN the system SHALL verify the vulnerability is actually fixed by the proposed remediation
3. WHEN generating test suites THEN the system SHALL include negative test cases to ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality
4. WHEN tests are created THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation on how to run and interpret test results

### Requirement 6: CI/CD Integration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Surakshit to integrate with our existing CI/CD pipelines, so that security remediations can be automatically tested and deployed following our established workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN remediations require pipeline changes THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate CI/CD configuration updates
2. WHEN integrating with pipelines THEN the system SHALL respect existing workflow patterns and conventions
3. WHEN suggesting pipeline changes THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation on the modifications and their purpose
4. IF pipeline integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback manual deployment instructions

### Requirement 7: Compliance and Policy Mapping

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want security fixes mapped to relevant compliance frameworks, so that I can track remediation against regulatory requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing vulnerabilities THEN the system SHALL map findings to relevant compliance frameworks (OWASP, CIS, PCI, etc.)
2. WHEN generating remediations THEN the system SHALL indicate which compliance requirements are addressed
3. WHEN compliance mapping is complete THEN the system SHALL provide references to specific framework sections and requirements
4. IF compliance frameworks are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain current mappings and notify of any changes

### Requirement 8: Human-in-the-Loop Approval

**User Story:** As a security lead, I want mandatory human approval for all remediation actions, so that no automated changes are made without proper oversight and authorization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN remediations are generated THEN the system SHALL never auto-merge or auto-push changes
2. WHEN approval is required THEN the system SHALL only accept explicit `EXECUTE:OPEN_PR` commands with valid approval tokens
3. WHEN unauthorized execution is attempted THEN the system SHALL reject the action and log the security event
4. IF approval tokens expire THEN the system SHALL require re-authorization before any execution

### Requirement 9: Auditability and Logging

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want complete traceability of all Surakshit actions and decisions, so that I can review security remediation processes for compliance and effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any action is performed THEN the system SHALL log the action with unique session_id and timestamp
2. WHEN generating outputs THEN the system SHALL include provenance information citing finding_id and evidence pointers
3. WHEN storing artifacts THEN the system SHALL use ULID (Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier) for chronological ordering
4. WHEN audit logs are requested THEN the system SHALL provide complete session history with all artifacts and decisions

### Requirement 10: JSON Output Standardization

**User Story:** As an integration developer, I want standardized JSON output from all Surakshit operations, so that I can reliably integrate with other security tools and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating any output THEN the system SHALL emit JSON with required fields: session_id, finding_id, strategies[], patch, rollback, tests, ci_changes, compliance, rationale, logs_ulid
2. WHEN JSON schema validation fails THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses following the same schema pattern
3. WHEN API responses are generated THEN the system SHALL include appropriate HTTP status codes and error handling
4. IF schema versions change THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility and provide migration guidance
